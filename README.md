# Classic-Neural-Network
Classic Neural Network is contain MLP( with Back propagation) / Hopfield network, and two of them are using java and GUI is using JavaFX to program.

## OverView
  these program can be used to solve the simple classification problem, and view the result with data visualization. you can set the `momentum`,`learning rate`,`epoch`,`dense`, and`dense unit`, activation function of MLP is fixed using `sigmoid`, otimization method is fixed `Back propagate`.
## Usage
  Choose the network, and download the folder, then use Java compiler to compile.
## Feature
  #### MLP(BP)
  * Pocket algorithms.
  * Dynamic adjust learning rate.
  * Result will show in `RMSE` and  `Accuracy`
  * Cross validation to improve training
 
 #### Hopfield Network
 * asynchronous recall
 * user decide noise probability (probability > 0.25 may let the recall not completely correct)
